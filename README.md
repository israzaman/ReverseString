# ReverseString
This is a simple .net console application with docker implementation

# Description: 

This is a simple .net console application which will solve small challenge of reversing string. It will take string as an input and reverse the string and output result in console and also will save it in file.

A docker image is built for this app and also the solution is run in docker container (Docker Desktop).

Running in docker and saving files in the container will be destroyed if docker stops the container. Therefore, a solution is provided to keep the file persistent.

# Docker instructions:

## To Build the docker image:

 docker build -t myimage .

## To run the docker image:

 docker run -it myimage

*****To persist files in docker container docker volumes can be used. Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.*****

## To Create a docker volumn:

 docker volume create myvol

## To Inspect a docker volumn:

 docker volume inspect myvol

## To run a docker image with a volume:

 docker run -it -v myvol:/vol myimage
